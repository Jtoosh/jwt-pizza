# Learning notes

## JWT Pizza code study and debugging

As part of `Deliverable â“µ Development deployment: JWT Pizza`, start up the application and debug through the code until you understand how it works. During the learning process fill out the following required pieces of information in order to demonstrate that you have successfully completed the deliverable.

## Other notes

In trying to understand how the headers and footers are populated, it looks like all possible locations (endpoints) are simply stored as objects in an array called `navItems` which specifies things about them, like constraints that need to be met to be rendered, and where they are supposed to be rendered. I need to do some more digging to see if this is a common tactic and if it has a more technical name.
